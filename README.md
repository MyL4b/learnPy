## 📚 Project Overview

This project is designed for learning Python from scratch in a clean, distraction-free environment.  
It was also created out of a personal need: as a computer science student, I constantly wanted to have **Python notes and a working IDE at my fingertips**.

Especially when I was new to Python, having both an IDE and Python notes readily available was incredibly helpful. During my learning phase, I often faced limitations such as **not having an on-the-go IDE**, needing to **set up heavy software**, or being forced to use **online IDEs filled with ads and distractions**.

The goal of this project is to remove those barriers—allowing users to **tinker, experiment, and practice every day** without wasting time on setup, configuration, or switching between tools. That need for **simplicity, focus, and accessibility** is the main reason this project was created.


It consists of **two main components**:

### 1️⃣ Python Introduction Slideshow
- Displays Python learning slides (`1.jpg` → `35.jpg`)
- Supports:
  - Previous / Next navigation
  - Touch swipe gestures (mobile)
  - Automatic skipping of missing images
- Responsive and mobile-friendly

### 2️⃣ Browser-Based Python IDE
- Runs real Python code using **WebAssembly**
- Features:
  - Syntax-highlighted editor
  - Interactive `input()` support
  - Output console with error handling
  - Mobile-friendly layout
- Powered by:
  - **Pyodide** (Python runtime)
  - **Monaco Editor** (VS Code editor engine)
